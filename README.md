# DDOSDetector
Detect DDos attack 
Designed and implemented an algorithm that imitates real time DoS attack detection by reading records from Apache Log files.  Developed an efficient data structure to read records from the log files and detect whether an attacker is a part of the DoS attack within 2minutes after the attack.

To execute

python ddetect.py -i <input_file> -o < output file> -n <threshold>
